The MCG, currently is the largest cricket stadium on earth and it is also the 11th largest stadium in the world. Cricket, Rugby and Australian Rules Football are the major sporting events held regularly at the MCG, while it has also played host to the 1956 Summer Olympics, the 2006 Commonwealth Games and a few of the FIFA World Cup qualifier games.\\n\\nThe MCG is colloquially referred by the locals as \\u0027The G\\u0027. Due to safety measures, the MCG\\u0027s capacity, which was well over 100000, was reduced to its current arrangement. The MCG gave birth to the Test match format on March 15, 1877, when Australia and England took on each other in a timeless match. Since then, the ground has been center-stage to over 100 Test matches, including the famous Boxing Day Test match, that is held every year on December 26. Interestingly, cricket\\u0027s first ODI match was also held at the MCG.\\n\\nThe 171m x 146m field at the MCG is surrounded by four stands - Great Southern Stand, MCC Members\\u0027 Reserve, Olympic Stand and Ponsford Stand - named in honour of Victorian batsman Bill Ponsford. From the first wooden members\\u0027 stand in 1854, the MCG has seen a series of enhancements to take its current shape. The infamous Bay 13, known as one of the worst behaved sections in the cricketing fraternity, is a part of the Southern Stand.\\n\\nThe first scoreboard at the MCG was built in 1882. Since then, it has taken many forms and is currently the best and the largest scoreboard available in Australia - state-of-the-art LED-high-definition screen which is 25.24 metres wide and 13.17 metres high. The current facility enables one to see both, batting and bowling cards on one screen. Also, it was at the MCG that Australia\\u0027s first full colour video scoreboard was put in place. The world\\u0027s first all-colour cricket scoreboard with instant replays was installed at the MCG.\\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eHow does the pitch play?\\u003c/b\\u003e\\n\\nThe 22-yards at the MCG is considered to be one of the most competitive surfaces in the world. It offers a fine balance between bat and ball. While the bowlers get some assistance early on with mostly genuine bounce, as it gets old, the batsmen can play their strokes freely. However, generally, the spinners do not get much of a purchase at the MCG.\\n\\nSince 1996, MCG has been host to the drop-in pitches. \\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eWhat is a drop-in pitch?\\u003c/b\\u003e\\n\\nA drop-in pitch is a cricket pitch which is prepared away from the ground or venue in which it is used, and literally \\\"dropped in\\\" to place for a cricket match. This allows multi-purpose venues to host other sports and events with more versatility than a dedicated cricket ground would allow.

It is owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and comes under the aegis of the West Zone.\\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eVenue History:\\u003c/b\\u003e\\n\\nBefore this stadium came into existence, international matches were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation\\u0027s stadium, bearing the same name. However, in 1982, the Gujrat government donated a 50-acre land on the banks of the Sabarmati river and the Motera stadium was constructed in a span of only nine months. The first international match to be hosted here was a Test between India and West Indies on November 12, 1983. \\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eVenue Description\\u003c/b\\u003e:\\n\\nThe Motera stadium has been witness to several important landmarks. It is also the adopted home of the Indian Premier League franchise Rajasthan Royals. The current stands are as follows - GMDC Upper and Lower stands, East Upper and Lower Pavilion, Adani Lower Pavilion, Adani Upper Pavilion, Club Pavilion, and West Pavilion. All stands, except the Club and West Pavilions, consistent two tiers. The Adani Pavilion consists of more than 20 air-conditioned corporate boxes as well as the player dressing rooms. The stadium has 21 entry gates. The ground was renovated in 2006, just before the Champions Trophy. After renovation, state-of-the-art floodlights were added to the stadium along with covered stands, three new pitches and a new outfield.\\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eHow does the pitch play?\\u003c/b\\u003e\\n\\nThe Motera offers a slow wicket. Initially, it was a bowler-friendly track but over the course of time, the pitch lost its spice as it started to slow down. Very few Test games have reached a conclusion over here.\\n\\n\\u003cb\\u003eTrivia\\u003c/b\\u003e:\\n\\nSunil Gavaskar became the first-ever cricketer to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket on this ground - a feat he achieved against Pakistan in 1986-87.\\n\\nKapil Dev claimed his 432nd Test wicket on this ground to become the highest wicket-taker in the world, breaking Sir Richard Hadlee\\u0027s record in 1993.\\n\\nby \\u003cb\\u003eSonali Dhulap\\u003c/b\\u003e\",\n",
